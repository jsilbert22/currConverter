# Currency Converter

"Currency Converter" is a Java/Maven project used for converting between currencies. This application was originally intended for frequent travelers such as ourselves; however, we expect that it would be helpful to anyone generally interested in the relative value of currencies worldwide. 

In this application, users are provided with a window that allows them to select the currency they want to convert from as well as the currency they want to convert to. Upon hitting "Convert," the application draws upon the ExchangeRate API to determine the exchange rate between the selected currencies.

Using Currency Converter is very straightforward, but instructions are included under the "Help" menu item that appears when the application is run. We've also included Spanish and French translations of the user interface to better serve users worldwide.

For programmers working within the repository, CurrencyConverter.java is our main class.

Technologies used:
* Maven
* ExchangeRate API
* JFrame

This project was inspired by [currency-converter-in-java](https://github.com/projectworldsofficial/currency-converter-in-java)
